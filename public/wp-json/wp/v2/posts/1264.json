Some good water. Is any water suitable for drinking? Of course not, but it can be treated to be ready for consumption.<\/p>\n<p>It is a common belief that coffee beans and brewing methods are crucial for preparing flavourful drinks. No wonder owners of coffee shops, restaurants and even individual users focus mostly on choosing the right coffee machine and coffee beans supply.<\/p>\n<p>However, even the best professional coffee maker is not enough to deliver a perfect cup of coffee. <strong>It is water, not the machine itself, that affects the most critical process of coffee making, which is coffee extraction.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The water quality translates directly to the coffee flavour. <strong>If water composition is poor<\/strong>, it won\u2019t be able to distil the aromas condensed in the beans. All the gourmand potential of coffee will be lost, along with the perfect blend and toast. And even a state-of-the-art coffee maker won\u2019t make a difference here. As you may think, good water for the HoReCa industry matters a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Water composes food and drinks. But water, surprisingly, is a composition itself, too.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Pure water in HoReCa \u2013 fresh and balanced <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>What is exactly a water composition? It is a general term for chemical compounds found in water, that affect the sweetness and acidity of coffee. <strong>The perfect balance of minerals is what makes water good water for HoReCa.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key for good water for HoReCa is to keep optimal proportions between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>calcium<\/strong> (Ca2 +) \u2013 it helps with coffee flavour extraction. But if present in large amounts, it bonds with bicarbonate particles and forms limescale deposits.<\/li>\n<li><strong>magnesium<\/strong> (Mg2 +) \u2013 it makes the coffee flavour \u2018shine\u2019, therefore it is the most desired mineral by coffee lovers. However, too much magnesium can harm the brewing equipment, covering it with rust.<\/li>\n<li><strong>sodium<\/strong> (Na +) \u2013 acts in the opposite way to magnesium, as too much Na+ can make it difficult for the coffee to brew.<\/li>\n<li><strong>bicarbonates<\/strong> (HCO3-) \u2013 this team is responsible for keeping the water pH balanced. But pay attention to bicarbonates levels, as any excess or deficit can make the coffee taste too flat or too acidic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To maintain an accurate and balanced level of minerals in the water, a suitable water filtration system is a must.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1051\" src=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-09-09-at-13.42.45-1024x679.jpeg\" alt=\"spottless-glass-filled-with-crystal-icecubes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-09-09-at-13.42.45-1024x679.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-09-09-at-13.42.45-500x331.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-09-09-at-13.42.45-768x509.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2021-09-09-at-13.42.45.jpeg 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Use filters to make your water good for HoReCa<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Every barista and restaurant manager would agree that a well-suited water filtration system is everything when it comes to coffee brewing and preparing the food. Good, filtered water <strong>delivers both fragrance and flavour<\/strong>\u00a0but also <strong>guarantees trouble-free operation<\/strong> of HoReCa equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Water filtration system protects coffee machines, boilers, kettles and taps from limescale. Hard scale residue is quite a problem in the HoReCa industry, as it reduces the efficiency and performance of brewing and cooking devices. As a result, the equipment needs even more frequent servicing, which generates higher operating costs.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to assess water quality, <strong>you need to check a few essential parameters, such as<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>general hardness (GH)<\/li>\n<li>carbonate hardness (KH)<\/li>\n<li>the acidity or alkalinity of the water (pH)<\/li>\n<li>the level of mineral salts that affect the taste of coffee (TDS)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The perfect water profile<\/strong> for preparing and serving drinks should look like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>GH \u2013 50-110 ppm<\/li>\n<li>KH \u2013 40-70 ppm<\/li>\n<li>pH \u2013 6,5-7,5<\/li>\n<li>TDS \u2013 100-170 ppm<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Mind the TDS parameter<\/strong>, especially. It should reach a max of 150 ppm to guarantee flavourful brews.<\/p>\n<p>Is it possible for any HoReCa business to sustain these parameters and water quality? Yes, it is, but only if a proper water filtration system is applied. By \u2018proper\u2019 we mean that the choice of filtration system should be based on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the initial water parameters = water quality before filtration<\/li>\n<li>the final water parameters = the desired water quality after filtration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Therefore, before you invest in the water filtration system, always check the water parameters to choose the best water filtration technology.<\/p>\n<p>A simple in-house water test will do, but we recommend checking your water sample at a dedicated laboratory. If you already know your initial water parameters, and you also know what kind of water you want to have, it is time to choose a suitable filtration method.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>How Bluefilters Professional guarantees good water for HoReCa<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Bluefilters Professional offers water filter solutions for business applications.
