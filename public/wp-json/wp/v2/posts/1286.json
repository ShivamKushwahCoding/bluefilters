Water is a base for every meal served at the table, and for every hot and cold drink available at the bar.<\/p>\n<p>Water also makes your dishes and cutlery crystal-clear, secures a failure-free operation of cooking and cleaning equipment, such as dishwashers, ovens, coffee makers and others.<\/p>\n<p>To deliver all this, <a href=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/sector\/horeca-water-filters\/\">your restaurant needs water without limescale<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Water with limescale can damage your restaurant business<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Any chef will probably say that the foundation of good cuisine is high-quality produce, a creative kitchen crew and &#8230; reliable equipment. Therefore, every restaurant owner-to-be spends a lot of time choosing the right gastronomic appliance, maximizing its functionality while ensuring high efficiency and durability.<\/p>\n<p>Does the water affect the operation of the kitchen devices? It surely does. <strong>If a restaurant uses hard water, it may cause limescale build-up on the machines and will lead to inefficient operation and overuse of the devices.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Limescale deposits can damage the equipment, and as a consequence, the machines will need more frequent servicing. This means more food service downtimes and fewer customer visits.<strong> As a result, the business loses money twice: <\/strong>because of the machine repair and because of the lack of guests.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Water without limescale<\/strong><strong> saves money and time<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Water without limescale is within reach for any restaurant and HoReCa business. The solution is to install an appropriate water filter for gastronomic devices.<\/p>\n<p>Water filter systems differ depending on the device they will be used with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>for gastronomic dishwashers, convection ovens and steamers<\/strong> \u2013 the water should be free of calcium and magnesium,<\/li>\n<li><strong>coffee makers, kettles, boilers and other devices for preparing drink<\/strong>s \u2013 the level of calcium and magnesium should be balanced to retain water flavour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The optimal water filtering solution should be based on the quality of water available at the premises, and the desired treated water parameters.<\/p>\n<p>Bluefilters Professional offers solutions perfectly matched with the HoReCa industry. Bluefilters water filtration systems for professional use are adapted to the point of use and the quality of the water available on-site. They do great in all kinds of catering establishments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Water without limescale is a time-and-money saver in the restaurant business.
