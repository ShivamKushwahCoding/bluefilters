The number of glasses raised may differ depending on age and weight, but should not rely on water availability, especially at work.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why does hydration matter?\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Water directly impacts health and overall body and mind functioning:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">it regulates body temperature<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">it transports nutrients and flushes out toxins<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">it improves metabolism<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">it boosts cognitive functions<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An adult needs to consume about<strong> 2 &#8211; 2.5 litres of water every day<\/strong>. Regular water intakes support health and make up for natural water losses due to bodily functions. Any lags in water supply cause <strong>dehydration, which results in headache, fatigue, lack of concentration and mood swings<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Luckily, one can replenish the water deficiency with food and drinks. On average, 30 % of the water we consume each day comes from food, and the remaining <strong>70% from beverages<\/strong>, including juices, coffee and tea.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The mentioned brews have a <strong>diuretic effect<\/strong> on our bodies but their impact is not as big as we think. <strong>The amount of water we lose with coffee and tea consumption is marginal<\/strong> compared to the water supplied with these beverages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, water is opted for because it is calorie-free, and contains no stimulants and sugars, therefore is much more convenient for consumers with health issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The question is, how to address hydration and water availability in a workplace?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hydration in a workplace &#8211; tried, tested but so-so practices<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A typical full-time employee spends 40 hours a week at work and needs steady access to a water source. Drinking water is mandatory for each workplace, and there are many ways to provide easy access to fresh water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One of the most common ways is to fill staff kitchen pantries with <strong>bottled water<\/strong>. Bottled water is handy and is also a hygienic way of serving water, but it also <strong>comes with two major flaws &#8211; the waste of leftover water and the amount of plastic<\/strong>. Let alone the logistics and stocking of bottled water within reach of the workers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, plastic waste needs to be recycled, which generates extra costs for the company. The same problems occur with the water dispensers fed with giant 19-litre-bottles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The tap water could be a solution for plastic overload. However, <strong>water straight from the tap is usually of poor taste<\/strong>, which is found unpleasant by many employees. Under sink water filter is an easy fix, but that limits the drinking water source to one tap in the staff kitchen, which can be off-route for some workers, and thus make them hydrate irregularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is problematic also because <strong>people at work are preoccupied and have no time to fetch a glass of water<\/strong> from the kitchen or forget to take a sip when the water source is out of their sight. In effect, fatigue and headaches appear, affecting the employee\u2019s mood and work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Keep the employees efficiently hydrated in the workplace<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The more beneficial way to provide water for employees is to <strong>deploy <a href=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/product\/new-york-water-dispenser-reverse-osmosis\/\">dispensers fed with mains water<\/a> around the workplace<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Such dispensers can be placed in people-dense areas for easy water access. Another perk is that <strong>the dispensers (aka water coolers) come with <a href=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/sector\/office-water-filters\/\">professional water filters<\/a><\/strong> that turn regular drinking water into a beverage worth a sip. Seems like a perfect solution for hydration problems in every workplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Easy access to high quality, filtered water is the win of having the free-standing water dispenser at the establishment. Another one is the <strong>modern, sleek design<\/strong> of the water coolers, a casing in trendy colours and, of course, easy operation with a touch panel. Hence, drinking water dispensers can serve in the <strong>open space area, waiting rooms, conference halls, and even board offices<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Building healthy habits in the workplace<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Providing drinking water sources within the reach of the employees <strong>helps them stay hydrated during the business, and supports the habit of regular water drinking<\/strong> in their off-hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Easy water access at work <strong>boosts health and productivity, promotes networking<\/strong> and sparks random brainstorms with co-workers while pouring yourself a glass from the water cooler.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Taking a few short breaks during the work shifts can work well for everyone, regardless of the type of job. A well-hydrated mind works at top speed, and the overall well-being is satisfactory. Mains-fed water dispensers guarantee hydration safety in the workplace to everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drinking approximately eight glasses of water seems like a simple formula for staying hydrated throughout the day.
