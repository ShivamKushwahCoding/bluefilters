Take a look at your coffee maker. Does the coffee you brew with it taste exceptional? Does the brewing equipment work smoothly? You surely do select the coffee blend carefully to obtain an aromatic brew. And you also get rid of limescale deposits from your coffee maker often enough to keep it running.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you know you can boost the coffee aroma and flavour, but you have run out of ideas about what else you can do about it, we have a hint for you &#8211; improve the water quality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Water quality \u2013 what does it mean for the HoReCa sector?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Since the water makes up 98% of a coffee cup, one needs to focus on water quality, especially in the HoReCa sector. <strong>The use of water treatment filters is a must in terms of elevating the water taste and getting rid of limescale at the same time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are many solutions available in the water filtration market that address both problems. One can choose among water softening technologies to reduce the amount of limescale residue on the water installation and the coffee machine nozzles. One can also use dedicated filters to improve the water taste. Either way, proper preparation of the water for coffee brewing requires the use of a large set of filters to deal with all the issues effectively.<\/p>\n<p>A water treatment system takes up quite some space, and it usually won\u2019t fit in a cupboard under the coffee machine. <strong>To save on the room and to provide properly treated water, it may be a good idea to use a <a href=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/technology\/bluesoft-filtration-technology\/\">Bluesoft+<\/a> filter.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1830\" src=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bluesoft-improves-water-quality-in-coffee-shops-1024x538.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bluesoft-improves-water-quality-in-coffee-shops-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bluesoft-improves-water-quality-in-coffee-shops-500x263.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bluesoft-improves-water-quality-in-coffee-shops-768x404.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/bluefilters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bluesoft-improves-water-quality-in-coffee-shops.jpeg 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How does Bluesoft+ improve the water?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let us say a few words on what Bluesoft+ is \u2013 it is a multitask filter. It effectively eliminates limescale deposition and retains the minerals responsible for good water taste &#8211; calcium and magnesium.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bluesoft+ makes the water taste good<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When filtering water, <strong>Bluesoft + does not change the TDS parameter<\/strong>. This means that all calcium and magnesium salts are being preserved in the water. This aspect is crucial if you want to serve a flavourful cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>If the water is softened or filtered with the RO system, the TDS level is usually very low afterwards, which translates into a bland, dull taste of beverages. If you intend to use RO filtered water for making coffee, it must be mineralized beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>With Bluesoft+ the mineralization step is redundant, as the TDS level is not altered, and the brews stay fragrant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bluesoft+ makes the coffee maker limescale-free<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Bluesoft+ simply stops limescale from forming inside pipes and coffee machine water installation and nozzles. No limescale means expanded lifespan and low costs of equipment maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>Limescale prevention is crucial for keeping brewing equipment running 24\/7. <strong>Bluesoft+ guarantees limescale prevention of up to 99%<\/strong>. Another benefit of Bluesoft+ is that it removes the existing scale deposits and also prevents corrosion by adding a 3 to 5-micron protective layer inside water pipes and hardware.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How does Bluesoft+ water filter work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Bluesoft+ acts as a catalyst by accelerating the transformation of the calcium and magnesium minerals into harmless nanoparticles, still keeping the water tasty. Under proper installation, <strong>Bluesoft+ will work a minimum of 5 years<\/strong>. It also does not need any salt or chemical substances to regenerate, which makes it a cost-effective solution.<\/p>\n<p>Bluesoft+ was initially developed as <strong>an alternative to commercial softeners<\/strong> used for limescale control. Because commercial softeners discard sodium into the sewer systems during their regeneration process, many companies were faced with fines. Most cities do not permit sodium discard into the municipal wastewater systems, preventing the use of traditional water softeners. Therefore, a cost-effective alternative was needed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Where to use Bluesoft+ water filtration systems?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Bluesoft+ effectively treats large volumes of water, hence we highly recommend it for commercial use. Additionally, it has the potential to filter water as hot as 90 \u00b0C and as cold as 4 \u00b0C. Given that, the <strong>HoReCa sector will benefit from Bluesoft+ technology the most<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>One can apply Bluesoft+ to various equipment, such as hot and cold beverage machines (coffee makers, water boilers and water dispensers), dishwashers and ice makers. Whenever you run a coffee shop, a hotel restaurant, guest house or a bistro, Bluesoft+ will help you to prepare your signature brews and drinks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey, barista, can we have your attention, please?
